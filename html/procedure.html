                <p class="para">To demonstrate the technique of block diagram reduction to simply complex systems by
                    using visual illustration in virtual lab.</p>
                <ol style="padding:1rem 2rem" class="procedureSteps">
                    <li>When blocks are connected in cascade the reduced gain is Gn = G1 * G2 * …*Gn</li>
                    <li>When blocks are connected in parallel the reduced gain is Gn = G1 + G2 + …+Gn</li>
                    <li>When take-off point is shifted after the gain block, then the reduced gain Gn is modified by
                        adding a block of transfer function ‘1/G’ in series with the signal taking off from that point
                    </li>
                    <li>When take-off point is shifted before the gain block, then the reduced gain Gn is modified by
                        adding a block of transfer function ‘G’ in series with the signal taking off from that point.
                    </li>
                    <li>When summing point is shifted after the gain block, then the reduced gain Gn is modified by
                        adding a block of transfer function ‘G’ before the summing point. </li>
                    <li>When summing point is shifted before the gain block, then the reduced gain Gn is modified by
                        adding a block of transfer function ‘1/G’ before the summing point. </li>
                    <li>In order to eliminate the negative feedback loop in a closed loop system having the feedback H,
                        the block diagram is modified by <br><img src="../image/procedure7.png" width="400"><br>C(S) / R(S) = G / (1+GH),
                        where C(S) is the output, R(S) is the input and G is the gain block.

                        <li>In order to eliminate the positive feedback loop in a closed loop system having the feedback H, the block diagram is modified by <br><img src="../image/procedure8.png" width="400"></li>

            <h2>Steps for Reduction</h3>
                <ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Rule 1 − </strong>Check for the blocks connected in series and simplify</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 2 − </strong>Check for the blocks connected in parallel and simplify</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 3 − </strong>Check for the blocks connected in feedback loop and simplify.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 4 − </strong>If there is difficulty with take-off point while simplifying, shift it towards right.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 5 − </strong>If there is difficulty with summing point while simplifying, shift it towards left.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule 6 − </strong>Repeat the above steps till you get the simplified form, i.e., single block.</li>
